Book Store MERN Application


#Description
This is a full-stack Book Store application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack. The project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, hardware-software partitioning for web architecture, and secure API communication.


#Features

Complete CRUD Functionality: Users can add new books, view the collection, update details, and delete entries via a responsive React frontend.



Scalable Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js, featuring RESTful APIs and clean controller/route separation.



Database Integration: Utilizes MongoDB for persistent storage and management of book records.


Secure Communication: Implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to ensure secure data transfer between the frontend and backend.


Client-Side Routing: Powered by react-router-dom for smooth, single-page application navigation.


Modern UI: Built using React with modular components for high performance and maintainability.
